# Elevator-simulator
Here resides a C++ program that resembles the functions and logic of an elevator demonstrated by command line graphics.

## Features:
- Simulates the action and **logic** of a real life elevator.
- No matter how many people call it and wherever each of them wants to go, it can manage all their calls and handle all their requests as efficiently as possible.
- You can see the elevator's motion through floors and follow up its progress.
- You can see when a person gets in and gets out, and how many people exitted on each floor.
- You get a status update on every floor.
- Prone to crashes and erroneous inputs.
     
## How-to-use:
1. In spark.cpp, click run.
2. Enter the number of floors and the maximum capacity of the elevator.

3. Enter any number of calls (each call corresponds to one person, obviously).
4. Enter the floor from which the caller calls the elevator, and whether he wants to go up or down from there (the elevator can handle it even if you want to change the direction after the elevator reaches you).
5.
